# maa_1.0-1_all
This is a command-line app I made (linux package made with c). And don't worry about ccolors.h delete that then type cd /usr/include then type wget https://github.com/ShYaGo/maa_1.0-1_all/blob/8c561fdd4ed606a573f0dac085242776b9a9bae5/ccolors.h
Then type $ git clone https://github.com/ShYaGo/maa_1.0-1_all in your linux terminal then type sudo dpkg -i maa_1.0-1_all.deb. There! Now run maa.
